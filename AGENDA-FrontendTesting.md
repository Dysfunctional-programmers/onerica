# Frontend Testing

# Why tests?
  1. Figure out what we wanna do.
  2. Allow us to keep moving as the project scales

# Why not test?
  1. Code that changes, tests will have to change a lot
    - Temperance. Testing things that are valuable and / or fragile, and leaving the rest unspecified (that is, mutable).

# What to test?
  1. Testing redux (reducers) --- done, so easy!
  2. Testing components
  3. Testing components' connections
